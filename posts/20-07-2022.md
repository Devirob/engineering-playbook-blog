I’ve learned Jenkins some while ago (maybe year, maybe half of year ago…). Today I had to prepare some pipeline for my code. And what tuned out? That my knowledge is outdated. 

I think that we should have some general knowledge of a wide range – but details should come when we need it. When we need it – we know what we want to learn. We don’t waste time for outdated technology or outdated approaches. We don’t waste time for things that are unnecessary for our project. 
So – gain knowledge at general level and leave space in mind for the details for the day when you really need them.
